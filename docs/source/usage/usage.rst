Usage
=====

The FlowPrint package offers both a command-line tool for easy access and a rich API for full customisation.
This section gives a high-level overview of the different steps taken by FlowPrint to generate fingerprints.
We also include several working examples to guide users through the code.
For detailed documentation of individual methods, we refer to the :ref:`Reference` guide.
