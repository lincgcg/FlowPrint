Welcome to FlowPrint's documentation!
=====================================

FlowPrint introduces a semi-supervised approach for fingerprinting mobile apps from (encrypted) network traffic.
We automatically find temporal correlations among destination-related features of network traffic and use these correlations to generate app fingerprints.
These fingerprints can later be reused to recognize known apps or to detect previously unseen apps.
The main contribution of this work is to create network fingerprints without prior knowledge of the apps running in the network.
